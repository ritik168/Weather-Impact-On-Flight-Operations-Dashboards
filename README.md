# Weather Impact Analysis On Flight Operations 


## 📌 Project Title

Weather Impact Analysis on Flight Operations & Customer Experience


## 🎯 Project Objective

To analyze how weather conditions impact flight operations by evaluating delays, cancellations, on-time performance, passenger satisfaction, and no-show behavior, enabling airlines to improve operational efficiency and customer experience through data-driven insights.

## 🎯 Business Problems & Insights

1️⃣ How many total flights are operated in the given period?

A total of 5,992 flights were operated during the analysis period.


2️⃣ How many flights were impacted by weather conditions?

Out of total flights, 885 flights were affected due to weather conditions.


3️⃣ What is the average delay caused by weather?

The average weather-related delay is 10.39 minutes per flight.


4️⃣ How does weather impact the on-time performance of flights?

Flights impacted by weather have an on-time rate of 76%, showing that weather significantly reduces punctuality.


5️⃣ How many flights were cancelled due to bad weather?

There were 47 weather-related flight cancellations.


6️⃣ What percentage of flights are cancelled in bad weather conditions?

Only 5.49% of flights are cancelled due to bad weather, while 94.51% continue to operate.


7️⃣ How does weather affect passenger satisfaction?

No Weather Impact: Average satisfaction score is 7.0

With Weather Impact: Average satisfaction drops to 6.8

This shows that weather issues slightly reduce passenger satisfaction.


8️⃣ How do flight delays change over time due to weather?

Flights affected by weather consistently show higher delays over time compared to flights with no weather impact, especially during peak weather months.


9️⃣ Which time periods show higher weather-related delays?

Higher weather-related delays are observed during monsoon and winter months, indicating seasonal weather impact on flight operations.


🔟 How does weather impact flight no-show rates?

Weather conditions contribute to a 6% no-show rate, indicating passengers are more likely to miss flights during bad weather.


1️⃣1️⃣ Which travel purpose has the highest no-show rate during bad weather?

During bad weather:

Emergency travel shows the highest no-show count

Followed by Business travel

Leisure and Family travel are less affected.


1️⃣2️⃣ How does no-show behavior differ when there is no weather impact?

Without weather impact:

Leisure and Family travel have higher no-show counts

Business travel remains relatively stable.


1️⃣3️⃣ What is the overall operational impact of weather on flights?

Weather causes:

Increased delays

Reduced on-time performance

Lower customer satisfaction

Higher no-shows

Flight cancellations

This makes weather a critical operational risk factor.


1️⃣4️⃣ What key operational metrics are most affected by weather?

The most impacted KPIs are:

Average delay time

On-time performance

Passenger satisfaction

Flight cancellations

Passenger no-show rate.


1️⃣5️⃣ What business insight can be drawn from this dashboard?

Weather disruptions significantly affect flight punctuality, customer experience, and reliability, highlighting the need for better weather forecasting, contingency planning, and customer communication.
